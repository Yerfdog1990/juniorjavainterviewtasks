Create a singleton using a Private Constructor and a Public Static Final Field:
1.Declare a static final field in the class to hold the single instance.
2.Mark the constructor private to prevent external instantiation.
3.This approach ensures that only one instance of the class is created, and provides a simple way to access the instance.
